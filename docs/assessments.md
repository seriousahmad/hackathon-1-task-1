# Assessments: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

## Assessment Philosophy

Our assessment approach emphasizes practical application of embodied intelligence concepts alongside theoretical understanding. Assessments are designed to evaluate both technical competency and the ability to integrate multiple robotic systems components.

## Formative Assessments

### Weekly Quizzes (10% of total grade)
- Multiple choice and short answer questions
- Focus on conceptual understanding from readings and lectures
- Auto-graded with immediate feedback
- Covers material from the previous week

### Peer Code Reviews (10% of total grade)
- Students review and provide feedback on classmates' robotic implementations
- Emphasizes best practices in robotic software development
- Develops critical evaluation skills
- Conducted through GitHub pull requests

## Summative Assessments

### Simulation Project (20% of total grade)
- Design and implement a complete robotic simulation
- Integrate perception, planning, and control systems
- Demonstrate sim-to-real transfer capabilities
- Individual or pairs allowed

### Perception System Implementation (25% of total grade)
- Develop a multi-sensor perception system
- Integrate camera, LIDAR, and other sensor modalities
- Demonstrate object detection and tracking
- Individual project with detailed documentation

### Multi-Robot Coordination (25% of total grade)
- Design and implement coordination between multiple robots
- Demonstrate complex collective behaviors
- Include safety mechanisms and fail-safes
- Teams of 2-3 students encouraged

### Final Integrated System (10% of total grade)
- Present a complete robotic system integrating all course concepts
- Live demonstration required
- Includes safety analysis and ethical considerations
- Comprehensive documentation required

## Assessment Rubrics

### Technical Implementation (40%)
- Correctness of implementation
- Efficiency and optimization
- Code quality and documentation
- Adherence to best practices

### Problem-Solving (30%)
- Analysis of the problem
- Appropriate selection of methods
- Creative approaches to challenges
- Validation of results

### Communication (20%)
- Clarity of documentation
- Quality of presentations
- Ability to explain technical concepts
- Professional reporting standards

### Collaboration (10%)
- Effective teamwork (for group projects)
- Contribution to peer learning
- Professional interaction
- Conflict resolution

## Accommodation Policies

- Extended time available for students with documented needs
- Alternative assessment formats available when appropriate
- Flexible submission options for technical difficulties
- Individual consultation for specific challenges

## Feedback Mechanisms

### Immediate Feedback
- Auto-graded quizzes with explanations
- Continuous integration feedback on code submissions
- Simulation validation results

### Detailed Feedback
- Written feedback on major projects within one week
- One-on-one meetings for complex challenges
- Peer feedback through structured review processes

### Iterative Improvement
- Opportunity to resubmit certain assignments with penalty
- Incremental project development with milestone feedback
- Portfolio approach allowing improvement over time

## Academic Integrity

All assessments must represent original work. Collaboration is encouraged for learning but must be appropriately attributed. Use of AI tools must be disclosed and justified. Code reuse from external sources must be properly cited.

## Technical Requirements

Students must have access to:
- Development computer capable of running simulations
- Reliable internet connection
- Appropriate software licenses (provided through course)
- Basic robotic hardware for final project (shared resources available)
